# Vat-Ensuring-Program
TAX is a common term for most of us. But most of time, the Government cannot manage to collect accurate tax from the general shops and super shops. 
So, this project is intend to solve these issue. Here we will enlist all the shops in this country.
Every single shop will be enlisted to the Govt. through the designated website or mobile app. Every goods or products can be traced through Bar Code/ QR Code. The company will upload the amount of products with its Bar Code to the App which will be in Govt. Database. 
The distributor will upload the codes of those products to site which will merge to the Govt. Database. Then the enlisted shop owners will receive the products and update those data to the site. At the end of the year, the govt. will able to calculate 99.9 percent owners vat and can reduce the current vat from 15-20 to 12-15 percent which will encourage people to give tax.
They can pay the vat from the mobile app also via mobile Banking system.
